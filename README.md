## Installation

The recommended way to install the package is via [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#pip). Before installing, make sure your packaging tools are up to date by running:

`pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`

Next, choose the installation method that best fits your use case:

- **Editable install directly from GitHub:** 
  If you only want to use the package or make light modifications, you can install it directly from the repository with:
  `pip install -e git+https://github.com/AndreasSchachner/jaxpolylog.git#egg=jaxpolylog`

- **Editable install from a local clone (recommended for development):**  
  If you plan to actively develop or experiment with the code, first download or clone the repository. Then navigate to the root directory of the project in a terminal and run:
  `pip install -e .`  
  The `-e` (editable) option ensures that any local code changes take effect immediately without requiring reinstallation.
